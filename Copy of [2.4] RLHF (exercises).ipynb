Much of this follows on directly from the PPO implementation from yesterday, with only a few minor adjustments and new concepts. You'll (hopefully) be pleased to learn that we're disposing of OpenAI's gym environment for this final day of exercises, and instead going back to our week 1 roots with TransformerLens!\n","\n","We'll start by discussing how the RL setting we've used for tasks like CartPole and Atari fits into the world of autoregressive transformer language models. We'll then go through standard parts of the PPO setup (e.g. objective function, memory buffer, rollout and learning phases) and show how to adapt them for our transformer. Finally, we'll put everything together into a `RLHFTrainer` class, and perform RLHF on our transformer!\n","\n","> **Note - these exercises assume you're running on an A100 (either a virtual machine or Colab Pro+).** If you're running on a less powerful machine e.g. A10, we recommend changing `\"gpt2-medium\"` to `\"gpt2-small\"`.

Intuitively, this is because both networks need to learn some kind of high-level encoding of the important variables in the environment - they just do different things with this encoding.\n","\n","This leads to the idea of a **value head**. A value head is basically just a simple classifier model which we stick to one of the policy network's internal activations. You can think of this as a kind of feature extraction. When it comes to transformer models, we usually attach our value head to **the value of the residual stream at the very last layer, after layernorm but before unembedding**. Recall the key idea of **residual stream as output accumulation** - by the very last layer, it contains the most context about the overall sequence.\\*\n","\n","\\*Technically this might not always be true, since there is some evidence that components of a transformer erase information in order to write different information to the residual stream. However, in practice we usually find that the residual stream at the last layer is the most useful for downstream tasks.\n","\n","How do we implement this?

We can attach a hook function to the residual stream at the final layer, and have it apply our value head to the residual stream values & store the output externally. Then we can use `model.run_with_hooks` to get our logits like normal, and fetch our value estimate from the external storage object.\n","\n","We're used to using hook functions during inference mode to perform causal interventions or compute statistical functions of our activations, but they can also be used during training mode to perform computations which are part of the autograd's computational graph.\n","\n","</details>\n","\n","Engineering-wise, we can get a GPTwithvaluehead class by wrapping around the `HookedRootModule` (like in reference page) but adding a value head.

Otherwise, here's a quick refresher:\n","\n","- The simplest form of sampling is **greedy sampling**, where we autoregressively generate text by always choosing the most likely token at each step (i.e. argmaxing over logits), appending this to our sequence, and continuing.\n","- Most other forms of sampling are non-deterministic, i.e. they involve randomness. The most basic form of random sampling is choosing the next token according to the model's logit distribution.\n","- Other common refinements of this basic method are:\n","    - **Top-k sampling**, where we only consider the top-k most likely tokens at each step, and choose from these according to the model's logit distribution.\n","    - **Top-p sampling** (also called **nucleus sampling**), where we only consider the top-p most likely tokens at each step, and choose from these according to the model's logit distribution.\n","\n","We've provided the model sampling code for you below, because there are a few non-obvious things to consider that are specific to our current situation. Make sure you completely understand this function before moving on to the next section.\n","\n","We'll highlight a few things about this function:\n","\n","- `.generate` is the standard method to autoregressively generate text. This works for TransformerLens slightly differently than for HuggingFace models (TransformerLens isn't primarily designed for text generation). In particular, it doesn't have features to efficiently generate multiple outputs for a single completion by using key-value caching. So rather than passing an argument into `generate` telling the model to generate `batch_size` outputs, we've instead just repeated `input_ids` multiple times across the batch dimension. This is a bit wasteful since we're repeating computation on the input sequence, but it's not a big problem because the input sequences we'll be using are usually very short.\n","    - As a bonus exercise later, we've suggested you write a version of the `generate` method which uses TransformerLens' key value caching (since TL does support caching behaviour, it just doesn't have features to use caching in `generate` to produce multiple sequences from a single completion).\n","- We've used `stop_at_eos = False`, to make sure that the model generates the full `gen_length` tokens rather

Can you go even larger?\n","\n","See [this page](https://neelnanda-io.github.io/TransformerLens/generated/model_properties_table.html) for a table of model properties, for all models currently supported by TransformerLens. Note that if you use different model classes then you might need to change some parts of your code (e.g. if the name of the hook point where you added the value head happens to be different). You might also need to make other adjustments e.g. a smaller batch size (or a larger number of minibatches per batch, which is equivalent to smaller minibatch sizes).\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","### Differential Learning Rates / Frozen Layers\n","\n","When doing any kind of finetuning, it's common practice to either freeze earlier layers or have a smaller learning rate for them. You may have seen this in the feature extraction with ResNet34 exercises in the first week. In the exercises here we've trained all layers of the model equally, but you might want to play around with differential learning rates.\n","\n","Note that you can accomplish this using parameter groups - we already used parameter groups above to have a different learning rate for our base model and value head. It should be relatively straightforward to extend this to splitting parameters over different layers into different groups (hint - you can use `itertools.chain` to convert several iterables into a single iterable).\n","\n","You can also try entirely freezing earlier layers - this might also reduce your memory usage, and allow you to train larger models without getting cuda errors.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","### Hyperparameter sweeps\n","\n","You can do this to find the best possible hyperparamters for your RLHF training. Don't just measure on reward, can you use some combination of reward and avg kl diff to create a better metric? Can you use wandb's built-in [Bayesian search methods](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps/sweep-config-keys#bayesian-search) to more effectively sweep?\n","\n","Note - don't forget **temperature** when it comes to hyperparameter tuning. Temperature has an important effect on how the model learns, e.g. if the temperature is too high then the model will produce very high-variance outputs which will have very high KL with the reference distribution, and it'll be more likely to collapse into some incoherent mode.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","### Adaptive KL penalty\n","\n","The KL divergence penalty coefficient can be modified adaptively based on the KL divergence between the current policy and the previous policy. If the KL divergence is outside a predefined target range, we can adjust the penalty coefficient to bring it closer to the target range. Here is an example implementation:\n","\n","```python\n","class AdaptiveKLController:\n","    def __init__(self, init_kl_coef, hparams):\n","        self.value = init_kl_coef\n","        self.hparams = hparams\n","\n","    def update(self, current, n_steps):\n","        target = self.hparams.target\n","        proportional_error = np.clip(current / target - 1, -0.2, 0.2)\n","        mult = 1 + proportional_error * n_steps / self.hparams.horizon\n","        self.value *= mult\n","```\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","### TRL / trlX\n","\n","We've been focusing on building RLHF from the ground up, but there are several libraries which exist to abstract away manuy of the low-level implementation details we had to wrestle with. One of the best-known is TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning). The main docs page can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/index), and [this page](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/quickstart) gives a quickstart guide. You may find it much easier to use this library than to implement everything yourself!\n","\n","Read their documentation pages, and see what techniques they use to make RLHF more effective. Are there any that we haven't implemented here? Can you implement them yourself?\n","\n","You might also be interested in trlX, an expanded fork of TRL built by CarperAI to handle larger models for online and offline training (although their APIs are pretty similar).\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","### Learn a human preference reward model\n","\n","We've been working with a pre-supplied reward function, but you can try and train your own!\n","\n","We'll give some brief points of guidance here, for the task of training a reward function on the **summarization task**. Note that these instructions have been provided externally, so they've not yet been tested and might not work particularly well.\n","\n","1. Get a supervised baseline\n","    * [Here](https://zenodo.org/records/1168855) is a link to download the dataset for the TL;DR challenge containing posts from the Reddit corpus. Each post contains keys `content` and `summary` which are the original post and the human-written summary respectively.\n","    * You should throw out all summaries shorter than 24 tokens or longer than 48 tokens (to diminish the effects of length on quality); and choose a random subset of ~100k summaries to train on.\n","    * Run training to maximize the log-likelihood of these summaries.\n","2. Get reward model by training supervised baseline on human feedback\n","    * Download comparison data with the code `azcopy copy \"https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/summarize-from-feedback/dataset/*\" . --recursive`\n","    * Modify GPT-2 architecture by adding a randomly-initialized **reward head** at the end of your model.\n","        * Architecturally this is similar to the value head from earlier, but it's not the same thing - here we're trying to learn what the human reward will be; we're not doing RL yet.\n","    * Train your model (starting with base model given by supervised baseline weights, and reward head randomly initialized) to minimize `loss = log(sigmoid(reward_model(summary_0) - reward_model(summary_1)))`, `summary_0` is preferred by a human labeler (this data should be in the comparison data you downloaded).\n","    * You should normalize reward model outputs, like we normalized rewards in RLHF in previous exercises.\n","3. Fine-tune supervised baseline using PPO with reward model.\n","    * For these exercises we suggest using a larger model, ideally GPT2-Large or bigger. Remember you can freeze weights! Regardless, this will still take longer to train than your previous models.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","### Interp on RLHF'd models\n","\n","Currently, very little mechanistic interpretability research ahs focused on RLHF'd models. In [this blog post](https://blog.eleuther.ai/trlx-exploratory-analysis/), Curt Tigges walks through an example of how we can use mech interp to analyze a model which has been finetuned with a sentiment based reward function using trlX.\n","\n","The flavour of the actual mech interp done here is very similar to the indirect object identification exercises you might have done during the transformers & interp week. If you didn't do these exercises, we recommend you do them before diving deep into this material.\n","\n","Lastly, here's a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eUdvlJNqY9X0NAw9UUseZz6dFyRklCcOHQy8x3CbcBk/edit?usp=sharing) brainstorming some ideas for RLHF interpretability.

In other words, after a certain number of iterations of (rollout phase, learning phase), they add a third reward model learning phase, where the current policy generates many pairs of trajectories of some fixed timestep and the human rater chooses which one is best.
