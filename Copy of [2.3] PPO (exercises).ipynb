As an improvement over traditional policy optimization methods, PPO addresses key challenges such as sample efficiency, stability, and robustness in training deep neural networks for reinforcement learning tasks. With its ability to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation, PPO has demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of complex environments, including robotics, game playing, and autonomous control systems.\n","\n","In this section, you'll build your own agent to perform PPO on the CartPole environment. By the end, you should be able to train your agent to near perfect performance in about 30 seconds. You'll also be able to try out other things like **reward shaping**, to make it easier for your agent to learn to balance, or to do fun tricks! There are also additional exercises which allow you to experiment with other tasks, including **Atari** and the 3D physics engine **MuJoCo**.\n","\n","A lot of the setup as we go through these exercises will be similar to what we did yesterday for DQN, so you might find yourself moving quickly through certain sections."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Jw9yLGuUJWQY"},"source":["## Content & Learning Objectives\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZImx8sBRJWQY"},"source":["#### 1️⃣ Setting up our agent\n","\n","> ##### Learning objectives\n",">\n","> * Understand the difference between the actor & critic networks, and what their roles are\n","> * Learn about & implement generalised advantage estimation\n","> * Build a replay memory to store & sample experiences\n","> * Design an agent class to step through the environment & record experiences\n","\n","#### 2️⃣ Learning Phase\n","\n","> ##### Learning objectives\n",">\n","> * Implement the total objective function (sum of three separate terms)\n","> * Understand the importance of each of these terms for the overall algorithm\n","> * Write a function to return an optimizer and learning rate scheduler for your model\n","\n","#### 3️⃣ Training Loop\n","\n","> ##### Learning objectives\n",">\n","> * Build a full training loop for the PPO algorithm\n","> * Train our agent, and visualise its performance with Weights & Biases media logger\n","> * Use reward shaping to improve your agent's training (and make it do tricks!)\n","\n","#### 4️⃣ Atari\n","\n","> ##### Learning objectives\n",">\n","> * Understand how PPO can be used in visual domains, with appropriate architectures (CNNs)\n","> * Understand the idea of policy and value heads\n","> * Train an agent to solve the Breakout environment\n","\n","#### 5️⃣ MuJoCo\n","\n","> ##### Learning objectives\n",">\n","> * Understand how PPO can be used to train agents in continuous action spaces\n","> * Install and interact with the MuJoCo physics engine\n","> * Train an agent to solve the Hopper environment\n","\n","#### 6️⃣ Bonus\n","\n","We conclude with a set of optional bonus exercises, which you can try out before moving on to the RLHF sections."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"W0RWgomzJWQZ"},"source":["## PPO vs DQN\n","\n","Today, we'll be working on PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization).

When calling `next_obs = envs.reset()`, next_obs gets a batch of $N$ initial observations (pronounced \"next observation\"). PPO also initializes an environment `done` flag variable next_done (pronounced \"next done\") to an $N$-length array of zeros, where its i-th element `next_done[i]` has values of 0 or 1 which corresponds to the $i$-th sub-environment being *not done* and *done*, respectively.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/screenshot-2.png\" width=\"800\">\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"iyc6QMjFJWQc"},"source":["### Exercise - implement `get_actor_and_critic`\n","\n","```c\n","Difficulty: 🔴🔴⚪⚪⚪\n","Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪\n","\n","You should spend up to 10-20 minutes on this exercise.\n","```\n","\n","Use `layer_init` to initialize each `Linear`, overriding the standard deviation argument `std` according to the diagram.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://mermaid.ink/svg/pako:eNqFkUFrAjEQhf9KmFOFtbgqHpZW6OpR6KHeGinZZOwGTCLJ5FDE_96kQUp12-aSx8t7ZL7kBNIphAbevTj2bLvmlqUVYlcMDk-SnOdQ_Lw22qLw9SuHou5sNG-uCxVbzEccdmw8XrKtsP2XKJnpd3oxvwnm07xfvJKc_ezkW4Qk7WwYPXR-GUg9Tu4n9aX0HKnMiFYVcYOy8pq0HGBp_4dpB2ectn-DDbdmV636N6Ccy1ywu0KDCgx6I7RKX3fKHgfq0SCHJkmFexEPlEnPKSoiuZcPK6EhH7GCeFSCcK1FehgDzV4cAp4_AVkGnOE\" width=\"500\">\n","\n","Note, we've given you a \"high level function\" `get_actor_and_critic` which calls one of three possible functions, depending on the `mode` argument.

Once you do, you can try logging variables in the way described by [detail #12](https://iclr-blog-track.github.io/2022/03/25/ppo-implementation-details/#:~:text=Debug%20variables). This will involve adding code to the `rollout_phase` and `learning_phase` methods.\n","\n","Remember, you can log variables using `wandb.log({\"variable_name\": variable_value}, step=step)`.\n","\n","### Video Logging\n","\n","To control the frequency of video logging, you can edit the `make_env` function, which is found in the `part3_ppo.utils` file. In particular, the following code:\n","\n","```python\n","env = gym.wrappers.RecordVideo(\n","    env,\n","    f\"videos/{run_name}\",\n","    episode_trigger = lambda x : x % video_log_freq == 0\n",")\n","```\n","\n","creates a wrapper which logs video every `video_log_freq` episodes. You can change this argument, or you can use the argument `step_trigger` rather than `episode_trigger` to make the logging more uniform (because an episode-based trigger will log more frequently at first, because the episodes are shorter).\n","\n","For now you can leave this code as it is, because the default values should work fine."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jEep0ZKnJWQn"},"source":["### Exercise - complete the `PPOTrainer` class\n","\n","```c\n","Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴\n","Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵\n","\n","You should spend up to 30-60 minutes on this exercise (including logging).\n","```\n","\n","If you get stuck at any point during this implementation, you can look at the solutions or send a message in the Slack channel for help."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"metadata":{"id":"vEAxjHywJWQn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718132672157,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":264,"user":{"displayName":"Max Liu","userId":"01627597745768120009"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["class PPOTrainer:\n","\n","    def __init__(self, args: PPOArgs):\n","        set_global_seeds(args.seed)\n","        self.args = args\n","        self.run_name = f\"{args.env_id}__{args.exp_name}__{args.seed}__{int(time.time())}\"\n","        self.envs = gym.vector.SyncVectorEnv([make_env(args.env_id, args.seed + i, i, args.capture_video, self.run_name, args.mode) for i in range(args.num_envs)])\n","        self.agent = PPOAgent(self.args, self.envs).to(device)\n","        self.optimizer, self.scheduler = make_optimizer(self.agent, self.args.total_training_steps, self.args.learning_rate, 0.0)\n","\n","\n","    def rollout_phase(self) -> Optional[int]:\n","        '''\n","        This function populates the memory with a new set of experiences, using `self.agent.play_step`\n","        to step through the environment.

If we have a new observation space then it naturally follows that we need a new architecture, and if we're working with images then using a convolutional neural network is reasonable.

The idea behind this is that the early layers of our model extract features from the environment (i.e. they find the high-level abstractions contained in the image), and then the actor and critic components perform **feature extraction** to turn these features into actions / value estimates respectively.

This will make the convolutions easier to track. You shouldn't hardcode the number of input features assuming an input shape of `(4, 84, 84)`; this is bad practice!\n","\n","We leave the exercise of finding the number of input features to the linear layer as a challenge for you.

But for CartPole and for MuJoCo, we have a very small observation space (4 discrete values in the case of CartPole, 11 for the Hopper in MuJoCo), so there's no feature extraction necessary.\n","\n","</details>\n","\n","The only difference will be in the actor network. There will be an `actor_mu` and `actor_log_sigma` network. The `actor_mu` will have exactly the same architecture as the CartPole actor network, and it will output a vector used as the mean of our normal distribution.
