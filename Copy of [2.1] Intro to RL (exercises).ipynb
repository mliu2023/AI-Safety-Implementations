Trying to sum the sequence $1,1,1,\\ldots$ or $2,2,2,2\\ldots$ or even $2, -1, 2 , -1, \\ldots$ is a problem since they all diverge to positive infinity. An agent with a policy that leads to infinite expected return might become lazy, as waiting around doing nothing for a thousand years, and then actually optimally leads to the same return (infinite) as playing optimal from the first time step.\n","\n","Worse still, we can have reward sequences for which the sum may never approach any finite value, nor diverge to $\\pm \\infty$ (like summing $-1, 1, -1 ,1 , \\ldots$).\n","We could otherwise patch this by requiring that the agent has a finite number of interactions with the environment (this is often true, and is called an **episodic** environment that we will see later) or restrict ourselves to environments for which the expected return for the optimal policy is finite, but these can often be undesirable constraints to place.\n","\n","#### Divergence #2: why do we discount geometrically?\n","\n","***TLDR: geometric discounting is \"time consistent\", since the nature of the problem looks the same from each timestep.***\n","\n","In general, we could consider a more general discount function $\\Gamma : \\mathbb{N} \\to [0,1)$ and define the discounted return as $\\sum_{i=t}^\\infty \\Gamma(i) r_i$. The geometric discount $\\Gamma(i) = \\gamma^i$ is commonly used, but other discounts include the hyperbolic discount $\\Gamma(i) = \\frac{1}{1 + iD}$, where $D>0$ is a hyperparameter. (Humans are [often said](https://chris-said.io/2018/02/04/hyperbolic-discounting/) to act as if they use a hyperbolic discount.) Other than  being mathematically convenient to work with (as the sum of geometric discounts has an elegant closed form expression $\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \\gamma^i  = \\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}$), geometric is preferred as it is *time consistent*, that is, the discount from one time step to the next remains constant.\n","Rewards at timestep $t+1$ are always worth a factor of $\\gamma$ less than rewards on timestep $t$\n","\n","$$\n","\\frac{\\Gamma(t+1)}{\\Gamma(t)} = \\frac{\\gamma^{t+1}}{\\gamma^t} = \\gamma\n","$$\n","\n","whereas for the hyperbolic reward, the amount discounted from one step to the next\n","is a function of the timestep itself, and decays to 1 (no discount)\n","\n","$$\n","\\frac{\\Gamma(t+1)}{\\Gamma(t)} =  \\frac{1+tD}{1+(t+1)D} \\to 1\n","$$\n","\n","so very little discounting is done once rewards are far away enough in the future.\n","\n","Hence, using geometric discount lends a certain symmetry to the problem.
