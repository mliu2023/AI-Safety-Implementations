This is because RL libraries are notoriously buggy and susceptible to breaking changes, and we're working with a version which we know is compatible with the material. Annoyingly this version of gym is only compatible with `wandb==0.13.10` rather than the more recent `0.16` versions, which is why we've fixed that version in the requirements file.\n","\n","If you want to transition to `gymnasium`, it is possible (most of the material has been tested with gymnasium as well), but we chose not to make the transition because it wasn't worth all the breaking changes. A few bits of guidance if you want to use `gymanasium`:\n","\n","- We recommend pinning version `gymnasium==0.29.0`.\n","- You should replace `import gym.(x)` with `import gymnasiumn.(x)`, and replace `import gym` with `import gymnasium as gym`.\n","- The most important change is that `env.step` no longer returns 4 objects, it returns 5: `done` is split into `terminated` and `truncated`.\n","\t- `terminated` tells you whether the episode has ended because of environment-specific reasons (e.g. the cartpole has fallen over), and `truncated` tells you whether the episode has ended because the maximum number of steps has been reached. The relationship is `done = terminated or truncated`.\n","\t- You can deal with this by simply defining `done = terminated or truncated` everywhere (or the `|` operator if you're dealing with arrays), and use `done` in the same way as before. However, you could also try and use `terminated` rather than `truncated` when appropriate. Using `done` will only incentivize the agent to maximize its reward within the episode length (e.g. it could always fall over at the 499th step in CartPole-v0 and this would still be fine), but using `terminated` will have different behavioural effects. Can you see why this is?\n","\t- In day 1 material, you'll need to return a 5-tuple rather than a 4-tuple. Often this will just involve inserting `truncated=False` into the return tuple.\n","- `obs.reset()` now returns a 2-tuple of `obs, info` rather than just `obs`.\n","- The `infos` object is structured differently: it's a dict of lists, not a list of dicts.\n","\t- You should replace `infos[environment][\"episode\"]` with `infos[\"final_info\"][environment][\"episode\"]`, and `infos[environment][\"terminal_observation\"]` with `infos[\"final_observation\"][environment]`.\n","- Remove `self.seed()` in the probes.\n","- Pass `render_mode=\"rgb_array\"` into `gym.make` in the `make_envs` utils function.\n","- Comment out the `test_agent` function.\n","- When using atari, you'll want to use the gymnsasium library's built-in wrappers (found [here](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/wrappers/misc_wrappers/)), not the stuff in `atari_wrappers.py`."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XcgAnZZOyBYk"},"source":["## Setup (don't read,

It might render a little popup window showing the Atari game, or it might give you a RGB image tensor, or just some ASCII text describing what's happening.\n","\n","#### Terminology note - observation vs. state\n","\n","We use the word *observation* here as some environments are *partially observable*, the agent receives not an exact description of the state they are in, but merely an observation giving a partial description (for our gridworld, it could be a description of which cells directly adjacent to the agent are free to move into, rather than precisely which state they are in). This means that the agent would be unable to distinguish the cell north of the wall from the cell south of the wall. Returning the state as the observation is a special case, and we will often refer to one or the other as required.\n","\n","#### Observation and Action Types\n","\n","A `gym.Env` is a generic type: both the type of the observations and the type of the actions depends on the specifics of the environment.\n","\n","We're only dealing with the simplest case: a discrete set of actions which are the same in every state. In general, the actions could be continuous, or depend on the state.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bbH2a-upFEqd"},"source":["Below, we define a class that allows us to use our old environment definition from yesterday, and wrap it in a `gym.Env` instance so we can learn from experience instead.

We have:\n","\n","- **SARSA** = take action $a_t$, observe $(r_{t+1}, s_{t+1})$, then take action $a_{t+1}$, then update\n","- **Q-learning** = take action $a_t$, observe $(r_{t+1}, s_{t+1})$, then update, then take action $a_{t+1}$\n","\n","The key point being that *the action $a_{t+1}$ has to be computed before the SARSA update step, since SARSA updates on actions taken*. Whereas Q-learning updates should happen after the action $a_t$.\n","\n","Don't worry if you don't fully understand this, the order of operations for these 2 algorithms can get a bit messy. All you really need to understand is this: in both cases, the code variables `exp.obs, exp.act, exp.reward, exp.new_obs` in the observe methods correspond to the pseudocode variables $S, A, R, S'$, and in the case of SARSA we also have `exp.new_action` which corresponds to $A'$.\n","\n","\u003c/details\u003e\n","\n","#### Tips\n","\n","- Use `self.rng.random()` to generate random numbers in the range $[0,1)$, and `self.rng.integers(0, n)` for random integers in the range $0, 1, \\ldots, n-1$.\n","- The random agent results in very long episodes, which slows evaluation. You can remove them from the experiment once you've convinced yourself that your agents are doing something intelligent and outperforming a random agent.\n","- Leave $\\gamma =0.99$ for now.\n","\n","\n","When you run the code below, you should expect to see SARSA outperform  Q-Learning (by a lot at first, then this gap will narrow). They should both be slightly worse than the cheater, and *much* better than the random agent.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":0},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":16565,"status":"ok","timestamp":1717619704260,"user":{"displayName":"Max

table from `(state, action)` to the Q value. This is pure memorization, and if our reward function was sampled from the space of all functions, this is usually the best you can do because there's no structure that you can exploit to do better.\n","\n","We can hope to do better on most \"natural\" reward functions that do have structure. For example in a game of poker, there is structure in both of the actions (betting £100 will have a similar reward to betting £99 or £101), and between states (having a pair of threes in your hand is similar to having a pair of twos or fours). We need to take advantage of this, otherwise there are just too many states and actions to have any hope of training an agent.\n","\n","One idea is to use domain knowledge to hand-code a function that \"buckets\" states or actions into a smaller number of equivalence classes and use those as the states and actions in a smaller version of the problem (see Sutton and Barto, Section 9.5). This was one component in the RL agent [Libratus: The Superhuman AI for No-Limit Poker](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~noamb/papers/17-IJCAI-Libratus.pdf). The details are beyond the scope of today's material, but I found them fascinating.\n","\n","If you don't have domain knowledge to leverage, or you care specifically about making your algorithm \"general\", you can follow the approach that we'll be using in the second half of today's exercises: make a neural network that takes in a state (technically, an observation) and outputs a value for each action.

This is why the training loss curve isn't going to have a nice steady decrease like in supervised learning. We will extend experiences to $e_t = (o_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, s_{t+1}, d_{t+1})$. Here, $d_{t+1}$ is a boolean indicating that $s_{t+1}$ is a terminal observation, and that no further interaction happened beyond $s_{t+1}$ in the episode from which it was generated.\n","\n","### Correlated States\n","\n","Due to DQN using a neural network to learn the Q-values, the value of many state-action pairs are aggregated together (unlike tabular Q-learning which learns independently the value of each state-action pair). For example, consider a game of chess. The board will have some encoding as a vector, but visually similar board states might have wildly different consequences for the best move. Another problem is that states within an episode are highly correlated and not i.i.d. at all. A few bad moves from the start of the game might doom the rest of the game regardless how well the agent tries to recover, whereas a few bad moves near the end of the game might not matter if the agent has a very strong lead, or is so far behind the game is already lost. Training mostly on an episode where the agent opened the game poorly might disincentive good moves to recover, as these too will have poor Q-value estimates.\n","\n","### Uniform Sampling\n","\n","To recover from this problem and make the environment look \"more i.i.d\", a simple strategy that works decently well is to pick a buffer size, store experiences and uniformly sample out of that buffer. Intuitively, if we want the policy to play well in all sorts of states, the sampled batch should be a representative sample of all the diverse scenarios that can happen in the environment.\n","\n","For complex environments, this implies a very large batch size (or doing something better than uniform sampling).

Our environment is set up to automatically reset at the end of an episode, but when this happens the `next_obs` returned from `step` is actually the initial observation of the new episode.\n","\n","To see this, run the cell above again, but replace `rb.observations` with `rb.next_observations`. You'll see that the values corresponding to termination $d_{t+1} = 1$ are actually the new values of the reset environment. We don't want this, instead we want these `next_obs` values to be the out-of-bounds values which caused the episode to terminate.\n","\n","Run the code below to see how we handle this (make sure you understand this, because you'll need to implement this later on). The code also plots `buffer.next_observations`, and if you examine this plot you should see that the values $s_{t+1}$ corresponding to termination $d_{t+1}$ are out of bounds, which is what we want."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":750},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":556,"status":"ok","timestamp":1717619710949,"user":{"displayName":"Max

The exploration strategy is the same as\n","for Q-Learning: agents take a random action with probability epsilon, but now we gradually\n","decrease epsilon. The Q-network is also randomly initialized (rather than initialized with zeros),\n","so its predictions of what is the best action to take are also pretty random to start.\n","\n","Some games like [Montezuma's Revenge](https://paperswithcode.com/task/montezumas-revenge) have sparse rewards that require more advanced exploration methods to obtain. The player is required to collect specific keys to unlock specific doors, but unlike humans, DQN has no prior knowledge about what a key or a door is, and it turns out that bumbling around randomly has too low of a probability of correctly matching a key to its door. Even if the agent does manage to do this, the long separation between finding the key and going to the door makes it hard to learn that picking the key up was important.\n","\n","As a result, DQN scored an embarrassing 0% of average human performance on this game.\n","\n","### Reward Shaping\n","\n","One solution to sparse rewards is to use human knowledge to define auxillary reward functions that are more dense and made the problem easier (in exchange for leaking in side knowledge and making\n","the algorithm more specific to the problem at hand). What could possibly go wrong?\n","\n","The canonical example is for a game called [CoastRunners](https://openai.com/blog/faulty-reward-functions/), where the goal was given to maximize the\n","score (hoping that the agent would learn to race around the map). Instead, it found it could\n","gain more score by driving in a loop picking up power-ups just as they respawn, crashing and\n","setting the boat alight in the process.\n","\n","### Reward Hacking\n","\n","For Montezuma's Revenge, the reward was shaped by giving a small reward for\n","picking up the key.\n","One time this was tried, the reward was given slightly too early and the agent learned it could go close to the key without quite picking it up, obtain the auxillary reward, and then back up and repeat.\n","\n","[![Montezuma Reward Hacking](https://img.youtube.com/vi/_sFp1ffKIc8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sFp1ffKIc8 \"Montezuma Reward Hacking\")\n","\n","A collected list of examples of Reward Hacking can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRPiprOaC3HsCf5Tuum8bRfzYUiKLRqJmbOoC-32JorNdfyTiRRsR7Ea5eWtvsWzuxo8bjOxCG84dAg/pubhtml).\n","\n","\n","### Advanced Exploration\n","\n","It would be better if the agent didn't require these auxillary rewards to be hardcoded by humans,\n","but instead reply on other signals from the environment that a state might be worth exploring. One idea is that a state which is \"surprising\" or \"novel\" (according to the agent's current belief\n","of how the environment works) in some sense might be valuable. Designing an agent to be\n","innately curious presents a potential solution to exploration, as the agent will focus exploration\n","in areas it is unfamiliar with. In 2018, OpenAI released [Random Network Distillation](https://openai.com/blog/reinforcement-learning-with-prediction-based-rewards/) which made progress in formalizing this notion, by measuring the agent's ability to predict the output of a neural network\n","on visited states. States that are hard to predict are poorly explored, and thus highly rewarded.\n","In 2019, an excellent paper [First return, then explore](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12919v6.pdf) found an even better approach. Such reward shaping can also be gamed, leading to the\n","noisy TV problem, where agents that seek novelty become entranced by a source of randomness in the\n","environment (like a analog TV out of tune displaying white noise), and ignore everything else\n","in the environment.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"l5pfSrD4GT7N"},"source":["### Exercise - implement linear
